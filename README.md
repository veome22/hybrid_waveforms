# hybrid_waveforms

This is a repo to generate hybrid waveforms and calculate faithfulness.

The notebook to generate waveforms and calculate their faithfulness is [faith_for_hybrid_waveform.ipynb](faith_for_hybrid_waveform.ipynb).

The Cutler-Vallisneri formalism has been worked out in [gwbench_bias_calc.ipynb](gwbench_bias_calc.ipynb).
